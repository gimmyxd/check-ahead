# check-ahead
Helps you create consistent and transparent rules for accepting contributions to your open source projects.

## Rake Tasks
`check-ahead:commits` - checks the commits against defined rules
`check-ahead:generate_requirements` - generate rules from input

##<line>

**check-ahead** uses your **CONTRIBUTING.md** file

```
### Commit Message
Accepted commits messages:
<commits>

* PA-\<digits>
* maint
* docs
</commits>
```

This will generate a task `check-ahead:commits` which will allow only commit messages that match `(PA-\d+|maint|docs)`
