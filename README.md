# check-ahead
Helps you create consistent and transparent rules for accepting contributions to your open source projects.

**check-ahead** uses your **CONTRIBUTING.md** file

```
### Commit Message
Accepted commits messages:
<commits>

* PA-\<digits>
* maint
* docs
</commits>
```

This will generate a task `check-ahead:check-commits` which will allow only commit messages that match `(PA-\d+|maint|docs)`


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'check-ahead'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install check-ahead

## Usage

```ruby
# Rakefile

require 'check-ahead'
CheckAhead.load_tasks
```

## Configuration

The gem supports configuration for: commit_range, CONTRIBUTING.md path, base_tags

Eg.

```ruby
CheckAhead.configure do |config|
	config.commit_range = 'master..HEAD'
	config.contributing_md = "path_to_contributing_md"
	config.base_tags = [revert]
end
```

or ENVIRONMENT variables:

```ruby
base_tags = ENV['BASE_TAGS']
contributing_md =ENV['CONTRIBUTING_MD']
commit_commit_range = ENV['COMMIT_commit_range']
```

### Defaults(if no configuration is set)
```ruby
base_tags = %w[revert merge packaging]
contributing_md = File.join(Dir.pwd, 'CONTRIBUTING.md')
commit_range = 'master..HEAD'
```
